# Onboard
## First day onboarding for returning data science intern
Welcome aboard! This issue ticket will guide you to setup your system as your previous intern. In case you made major changes since your last day, you may want to refer back to your previous onboarding issue.
If at any point you need help, please reach out to Billy [@SweatyHandshake](https://gitlab.com/SweatyHandshake), Dan [@dfsnow](https://gitlab.com/dfsnow), or Sam [@ssimpson](https://gitlab.com/ssimpson).

### Email
When you work in the public sector in Illinois, and many other places, your work correspondence is considered official records. It is very important that you do not use your personal email account, person dropbox, google drive, or other file storage systems, or any other personal digital accounts or systems to do your work. __All CCAO work should be done using CCAO provided emails and file storage locations__. As a return intern you lost access to your previous email account, you must request to get the access again.
- [ ] Validate access to your previous CCAO email.

### VPN
You should recieve an email during onboarding from Admins or NCC with instructions on how to set up and access the CCAO network through a VPN. For VPN troubleshooting, email the CCAO [Admins](admins@cookcountyassessor.com).
- [ ] Validate access back to VPN.

### Teams
Ask [@SweatyHandshake](https://gitlab.com/SweatyHandshake) for an invite you back to the Data Science "Team" within the CCAO group.

### Accounts
Please create or reconfigure your accounts with the following services using your CCAO email.
 - [ ] [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) - Change your email back to your @cookcountyassessor.com email.
 - [ ] [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - Needed only for Sourcetree install

### System setup
All system configuration must be the same as you previous intern. Please review your previous onboarding issue:
- [ ] Validate installations and configurations as in previous onboarding issue.
- [ ] Bookmark important links as in previous onboarding issue.
- [ ] Validate Git, GitLab, and Sourcetree configurations.
- [ ] Validate the SQL Credentials.

### Hours and project assignments
Interns may work up to 20 hours per week. You are encouraged to do so; working 15 hours or less severly limits the quality of work you can do.
 - [ ] Please email your preferred schedule to [Rob Ross](admins@cookcountyassessor.com), including the days and times you will be working, and the date of your last day. Subject: 'YOUR NAME - Internship hours.'
 - [ ] Email [Rob Ross](admins@cookcountyassessor.com) to request a project and supervisor.

### Issue Resolution
The CCAO Data Science team uses [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) to structure its workflow. GitLab Flow uses a basic branch-per-issue system. Each issue or new feature is tied to a branch and merge request. Work is done on the branch, then merged to `master` after testing and review. Here's an example of a typical workflow:

1. You are assigned __Issue #118, Update Internal Contribution Guidelines__ within GitLab.

   - Check to see if there is a branch associated with your issue within GitLab. Branches created via issues usually have a similar name, in this case the branch name would be `118-update-internal-contribution-guidelines`.
   - If a branch doesn't exist, please ask your supervisor to create one. Please do not create a branch yourself.

2. Checkout the issue branch.

   - Within Sourcetree, click __Repository --> Checkout__, then select the branch associated with the issue you have been assigned. In this case, `118-update-internal-contribution-guidelines`. You can also double-click different branch names to check them out.
   - The branch you selected should now appear bolded under __BRANCHES__ on the left side of Sourcetree. You are now working within that branch.

3. Work the issue. Please use the issue page comments to communicate with your supervisor about the issue.

4. Commit often and use [descriptive commit messages](https://commit.style/). Only push to your issue branch, never directly to `master`.

5. When you have finished working on the issue, request approval for your merge request let your supervisor know you've finished working the issue.

See the [Version Control and Workflow](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/master/handbook.md#version-control-and-workflow) section of the handbook for more information.

### Intern Timesheets
During the first week of employment, interns will need to manually record their hours on a paper timesheet which is turned in at the end of each week. The timesheet can be found [here ðŸ“„](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/master/forms/Intern_Sign-in_Sheet.pdf). After that first week, interns will use the Cook County Time system to track their hours. Click [Dashboard login](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/cct) to log into CCT. __We recommend that you create a recurring calendar event to remind you to clock in and out.__

- The property assessment world involves a lot of real estate-specific jargon and vocabulary. A non-exhaustive list of commonly used vocabulary can be found in the [Sales Ratio Studies SOP](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/sops/sales-ratio-studies.md#definitions).

### Offboarding
