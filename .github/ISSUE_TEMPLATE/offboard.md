This page only applies to CCAO Data Department interns, capstone students, and fellows who are leaving at the end of their quarter/semester.

If you're reading this, then it's finally time to say goodbye. :sob: We're sad to see you go, but hope you've gained something from being a part of the Data Department! After leaving, you'll automatically lose access to your CCAO email address, CCAO private GitHub repos, the VPN, and Teams. Here are the things you need to do before you leave:

# Checklist

- [ ] Return any CCAO equipment (if applicable). Laptops should be returned directly to the IT department and should include any accessories (case, charger, etc.).
- [ ] Schedule an informal exit chat with your supervisor.
- [ ] Email [HR](assessor.ccaohr@cookcountyil.gov) to confirm your last day.
- [ ] Delete any stored CCAO read-only database credentials on your local machine (if applicable).
- [ ] Email the Chief Data Officer, Directors, and Senior Data Scientists:
  - A reminder to change the permissions on your GitHub account and remove you from any relevant GitHub teams
  - A reminder to revoke any private API/deploy keys
  - A reminder to revoke any relevant AWS permissions
  - Your contact information, in case we need to follow-up on something you worked on
  - A reminder to add you to the [list of former interns and employees used to generate model names](https://github.com/ccao-data/ccao/blob/master/data-raw/ccao_ids.R)
- [ ] Deliver your wrap-up memo (see below) to your project lead and the CDO via email

# Memo

In addition to the items above, we ask that you write up a short (one page) document summarizing your most substantial project of the quarter. The document should be understandable to an executive without a coding background and should cover:

- The problem you encountered
- The solution you implemented and any methods used
- The duration of the project
- The impact of the project
- Any remaining next steps

Upon completion, anticipate that the memo will be sent by the project lead/CDO to the:

- Chief Operations Officer
- Director of Data Integrity
- Chief Valuations Officer
- Chief of Staff

If you so choose, the memo may also be used as the basis for a Data Department blog post, which will publicly summarize your work. We will share this post with you upon completion. If you do not wish to be featured in public posts, leave the boxes below unchecked.

- [ ] I consent to my work being featured in Data Department public blogs posts
- [ ] I approve of the Data Department using my memo as the background material for such posts
