> :warning: This page only applies to CCAO Data Science Department interns and capstone students who are leaving at the end of their quarter/semester.

If you're reading this, then it's finally time to say goodbye. :sob: We're sad to see you go, but hope you've gained something from being a part of the Data Science Department! After leaving, you'll automatically lose access to your CCAO email address, CCAO private GitLab repos, the VPN, and Teams. Here are the things you need to do before you leave:

# Checklist

- [ ] Return any CCAO equipment (if applicable).
- [ ] Schedule an informal exit chat with your supervisor.
- [ ] Email HR to confirm your last day and arrange your exit survey and interview.
- [ ] Turn in your ID card to HR (at the same place you drop off your timesheet). If working remotely, mail your ID to the following address:
    ```
    ATTN: Human Resources
    Cook County Assessor's Office
    118 N. Clark St.
    Chicago, IL 60602
