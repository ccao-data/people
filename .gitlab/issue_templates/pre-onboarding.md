Welcome to the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) Data Department! We're excited to have you! This webpage is a GitLab issue. An issue is a way to track work that needs to be done. This particular issue coordinates the activities of different departments in order to make your onboarding experience seamless and efficient. Please read this pre-onboarding issue carefully, as there are tasks you need to complete. Once you complete each task, please mark the checkbox as shown below:

- [x] This task is complete.

If a task does not apply to you, please mark it anyways so we can track the progress of this issue. If you have a question at any point, please feel free to comment on this issue ticket. Commenting will generate an automated email, and we will help resolve your problem.

## Working Remotely

The CCAO Data Department is currently working on a hybrid schedule. We are in-office on Wednesday and Thursday and remote the rest of the week. In order to work with our department, you will need:

- A relatively fast internet connection 
- A quiet, comfortable workspace at home

The CCAO will provide you with a laptop. You may take this laptop home OR use your personal machine. More information about machine setup will be provided in a separate onboarding issue ticket.

## GitLab Setup

- [ ] You will need a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account. If you do not already have one, create a free [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account using your personal email address.
- [ ] Log in to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and comment on this issue ticket to let us know your username.

Please note that your GitLab account can persist after your employment/internship has ended and can be a valuable resource in your career. Your work will mostly be public, so please take a moment to review [GitLab's communication guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#effective--responsible-communication-guidelines). You may also want to explore GitLab to familiarize yourself with the platform. The CCAO's GitLab group can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling).
