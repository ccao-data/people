This issue ticket coordinates the **90-day, 180-day, and annual** performance review of the employee named in the issue title by a **deputy**. This process should only be used by employees in the Data Science department. This process is documented in the [Data Science handbook](https://datascience.cookcountyassessor.com/wiki/handbook/handbook.md#performance-review). Performance evaluations are completed in two parts: the preparation of the draft evaluation, and the meeting and post-meeting actions. This issue ticket pertains to the former part, and blocks by the issue for the first. 


### Preparation for annual performance meeting

#### Employees tasks

- [ ] The employee should complete the [Self - Evaluation form](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/master/forms/360%20Evaluation%20-%20Employee%20Self%20Evaluation.docx). They should save the completed form as a PDF titled "[Employee Name] Self-Eval."
- [ ] Optional: The employee can request that a peer complete a [peer evaluation](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/master/forms/360%20Evaluation%20-%20Employee%20Peer%20Evaluation.docx) of them.

#### Deputy's tasks
- [ ] The **deputy** schedules the performance review meeting with the **employee**, CC'ing [HR](CCAOHR@cookcountyassessor.com), [DOC](MSerio@cookcountyassessor.com), [ACA](susan@feibuslaw.com), and issue. The meeting must take place between 9/1 of every year and 1/20 of the following year.
- [ ] The **deputy** populates the appropriate performance review form: [FLSA Exempt](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/master/forms/20.09.09%20Performance%20Evaluation%20Form%20FLSA%20Exempt-Fillable-ALT.pdf), [FLSA Non-Exempt](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/career-development/employment/-/blob/master/forms/20.09.09%20Performance%20Evaluation%20Form%20Fillable-NONEXEMPT-ALT.pdf). Ensure that the following guidelines are met:

   * All performance factors have corresponding comments.
   * All scores of 1 and 5 have specific instances of the unsatisfactory or exceptional performance
supporting the score.
   * All scores of 1 and 2 have recommendations to the Employee for improving his or her performance.
   * Overall Average Score is calculated correctly (if done electronically, the Form will do this for you).


- [ ] The **deputy** sends form (via "reply-all" to initial email) to [HR](CCAOHR@cookcountyassessor.com), [DOC](MSerio@cookcountyassessor.com), [ACA](susan@feibuslaw.com), and issue at least **2 business** days in advance of the Evaluation Meeting.
