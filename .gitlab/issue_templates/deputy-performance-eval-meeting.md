This issue ticket coordinates the **90-day, 180-day, and annual** performance review of the employee named in the issue title by a **deputy**. This process should only be used by employees in the Data Department. This process is documented in the [Data Department handbook](https://gitlab.com/groups/ccao-data-science---modeling/-/wikis/Handbook/Handbook#performance-review). Performance evaluations are completed in two parts:

1. The preparation of the draft evaluation
2. The meeting and post-meeting actions

This issue ticket pertains to the latter part, and is blocked by the issue for the first part.
