This issue ticket coordinates the **90-day, 180-day, and annual** performance review of the employee named in the issue title by a **deputy**. This process should only be used by employees in the Data Science Department. This process is documented in the [Data Science handbook](https://gitlab.com/groups/ccao-data-science---modeling/-/wikis/Handbook/Handbook#performance-review). Performance evaluations are completed in two parts:

1. The preparation of the draft evaluation
2. The meeting and post-meeting actions

This issue ticket pertains to the first part, and blocks the issue for the latter part. 

### Preparation for Performance Meeting

#### Employee's Tasks

- [ ] **Employee** should complete the [Self Evaluation Form](/forms/performance-eval/360%20Evaluation%20-%20Employee%20Self%20Evaluation.docx). They should save the completed form as a PDF titled "[Employee Name] Self-Eval."
- [ ] Optional: The employee can request that a peer complete a [Peer Evaluation Form](/forms/performance-eval/360%20Evaluation%20-%20Employee%20Peer%20Evaluation.docx).

#### Deputy's Tasks

- [ ] **Deputy** schedules the performance review meeting with **Employee**. The meeting must take place between 9/1 of every year and 1/20 of the following year.
- [ ] **Deputy** populates the appropriate performance review form: [FLSA Exempt](/forms/performance-eval/Performance%20Evaluation%20Form%20Fillable%20EXEMPT.pdf), [FLSA Non-Exempt](/forms/performance-eval/Performance%20Evaluation%20Form%20Fillable%20NONEXEMPT.pdf). Ensure that the following guidelines are met:

   * All performance factors have corresponding comments.
   * All scores of 1 and 5 have specific instances of the unsatisfactory or exceptional performance
supporting the score.
   * All scores of 1 and 2 have recommendations to **Employee** for improving his or her performance.
   * Overall Average Score is calculated correctly (if done electronically, the Form will do this for you).
